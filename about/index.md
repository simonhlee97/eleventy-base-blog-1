I'm a Korean-born 'Hoosier' (a person from Indiana), so born in rice fields, grew up in corn fields.

I've also lived in Chicago and Seoul, and I've been in Korea since Nov. 2018, just in time for the Great Pandemic.

I enjoy books, tennis, golf, basketball, podcasts, New Yorker Magazine, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Simon and Garfunkel, tacos, pizza, and burgers.

### About this blog

My blog is mostly about tech and web-development topics, like JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, databases, Python, Flask, Django, etc. and everyday life as a Hoosier-expat in Korea.
