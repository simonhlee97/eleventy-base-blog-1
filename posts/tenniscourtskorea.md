Tennis (for Koreans) is a popular recreation activity, especially for newly-weds and older ah-jushiis and ah-jummas, but it can be hard to find nice tennis courts. Seoul has a limited number of public tennis clubs. If you don't live near one of these, you have to dig through Naver tennis blogs or satellite maps to spot individual courts. Many universities do have tennis courts, but may only be open to their students.

### Courts in Incheon

I was pleasantly surprised to find some nice tennis courts in Incheon. Because of recent events like the 2014 Asian Games (in Incheon), the government had to build new facilities there. I've taken my kids to a couple of the clubs in Incheon, and here are a few photos.
