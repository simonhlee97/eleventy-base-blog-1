Tennis (for Koreans) is a popular recreation activity, especially for newly-weds and older ah-jushiis and ah-jummas, but it can be hard to find nice tennis courts. Seoul has a limited number of public tennis clubs. If you don't live near one of these, you'll have to dig through Naver tennis blogs or satellite maps to spot individual courts. Many universities do have tennis courts, but may only be open to their students.

### Courts in Incheon

Here are a few recent photos from a couple Incheon tennis clubs.

### Reserving Courts

All the clubs I have visited use some type of online reservation system, so you will have to use Korean websites 😦 to book a court.
